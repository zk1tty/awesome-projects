## Agent Frameworks

These projects leverage `browser-use` or similar browser automation techniques as part of a larger AI agent system designed for general task completion or analysis.

*   [OpenManus](https://github.com/mannaandpoem/OpenManus) - An open-source multi-agent system inspired by Manus, designed to accomplish complex tasks using tools and browser interaction. 
*   [Agent-tars](https://github.com/bytedance/UI-TARS-desktop/tree/main/apps/agent-tars) - A multimodal AI agent that visually interprets web pages to perform browser operations and integrates with system commands. 
*   [nanobrowser](https://github.com/nanobrowser/nanobrowser) - A multi-agent system running locally in the browser for real-time analysis, featuring self-correction and dynamic navigation instructions. 

## Server Implementations & Protocol Integration

These projects focus on providing server backends or implementing specific protocols (like MCP) to facilitate AI interaction with browsers via `browser-use`.

*   [Saik0s/mcp-browser-use](https://github.com/Saik0s/mcp-browser-use) - An AI-driven browser automation server implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP) based on `browser-use` for natural language control. 
*   [JovaniPink/mcp-browser-use](https://github.com/JovaniPink/mcp-browser-use) - A server implementation for the `browser-use` library integrating Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) for AI agent browser interaction. 

## Specific Applications

Projects applying `browser-use` principles to solve problems in a specific domain, such as Quality Assessment.

*   [SDET-GENIE](https://github.com/WaiGenie/SDET-GENIE) - An AI-powered QA automation framework leveraging `browser-use` to transform user stories directly into executable test automation code. 

## Integrations & Ease of Use

Projects focused on simplifying the use of `browser-use` by providing wrappers, APIs, or extensions.

*   [A5-Browser-Use](https://github.com/AgenticA5/A5-Browser-Use/) - An all-in-one solution integrating `browser-use` with a user-friendly RESTful API and Chrome extension for simplified agentic browser automation.
